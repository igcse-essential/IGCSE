        <h3>What's After IGCSE?</h3>
        <img src="../images/what_next.jpeg">
        <p>
          Say you have already taken your IGCSE. You got the grades that reflects the amount of effort you have placed and you are very much happy. <br><br>
          Then, you stop for a moment and come across the question, 'What's next?'<br><br>
          I'm going to talk about the various options available but do remember that I am only sitting in grade 11 and my opinion can range from being very biased to be being very objective. These are just my thoughts and you final decision should be very much influenced by your own critical judgement. <br><br>
          PS: This post is mainly for people studying in Indonesia<br><br>
          Say, after your IGCSE, you would not like to enter a University. You are more of a 'hands on' type of person. If this is case, taking curriculums like the IBDP or A-level would not be the best option. Being a chef, a model, a stylist, real estate agent and etc. do not require you to have a university degree. If this is the case, I cannot speak much about it as my experience is extremely limited. What I think would be best is to find a mentor in the same field and as much as possible, do what's 'practical.' <br><br>
          What do I mean by that? <br><br>
          Say, if you want to be a stylist, then what you should be aiming for is to intern at a local salon. You can start there, building up experience. Once you have shown the people in the salon that you are serious and passionate about what you are doing, use this opportunity to approach someone if they can be your mentor. From their, your experience would only widen. The same case applies to that of a chef. Your experience and who you have as a mentor greatly affects your status when you are job-hunting. <br><br>
          That's the 1st option. <br><br>
          However, say you do want to get into a good University. Now, there are 2 obvious choices. Do you want to get into a local university or do you want to study abroad? If you want to get into a local university, then you must concentrate on nailing the national exams or what we know as Ujian Nasional. <br><br>
          However, if you want to study abroad like I do, I recommend to not go for the national exams.<br><br>
          (Please do note that the UN is mandatory for all Indonesian citizens. What I mean here is to not concentrate on it as if it is the determining factor of your admission)<br><br>
          It is not that it is not an option but if you are aiming for top-tier universities, the Indonesian national exam is not as acknowledged compared to other curriculums like the IBDP or the A-levels. There are obviously other curriculums like the AP but per my experience, IBDP and A-levels seems to be the most popular and most widely acknowledged curriculum by universities worldwide. <br><br>
          In the next post, I will cover both curriculums and also offer suggestions as to which one would suit you better. See you in the next one!<br><br>
