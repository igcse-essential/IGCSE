        <h3>Studying Efficiently</h3>
        <img src="../images/study2.png">
        <p>
          For the past 2 years, I have seen different types of methods in which students try to approach the IGCSE course. Some dedicate specific periods of time per day to revise coursework. Some rush it to the last few months, doing past papers till past midnight whereas some dedicate the weekends to do the studying. <br><br>
          Now, there is no right or wrong method here(the last minute one should really be avoided, though). What may work for me may not work for you. What I am simply delivering would be proven techniques that aid in concentration, focus, and memory.<br><br>
          The most major revelation I discovered was something called spaced repetition. I was used to this concept that if I want to study right, I would have to occupy 3 to 4 hrs of my time to focus on a topic. 'This aids with memory and focus,' people said. This is, for the most part, largely false. Dedicating so much time to one particular task may adversely affect the fruits of studying to most people. The major issue for most would be the discipline to stay dedicated and focussed but even if you can stay focussed, studying for huge blocks of time does not aid the brain in retaining material. <br><br>
          In fact, the way to go is to distribute this huge chunk of time to, say, 3 days a week. What this<br><br>
          does is that it allows the brain some time off, allowing its intricate systems a chance to consolidate the material received. Memory is not stored discretely like electrons (oops, bad analogy :)). They are not stored in one 'file' in the brain. Instead, when material is received, they are scattered all around and time is required for this information to be retained effectively for future reference. When you study huge chunks at one go, you are not allowing the brain this time period it requires to rest, and hence, a few days later, you forgot the material you have covered. Intensive periods once or twice a month is beneficial. During this period, focus on either past papers, active recalling, or self-testing. <br><br>
          A common mistake to avoid is passive learning. Re-reading your notes is not effective. Highlighting sentences in your textbook is definitely not. Active learning is the way to go and this is especially true for subjects such as Math, Chemistry, and Physics. When solving problems, understand why each step is appropriate and why does it work. To take another step forward, look for other methods to solve a similar problem as this challenges your brain. This type of method exponentially helps with retention. It is also a good idea to make concept maps as this allows the brain to be able to capture a visual representation of specific topics. Intensive periods are also recommended. <br><br>
          When revising, it is best not to multitask. Store your phone somewhere out of reach and sight. Lock distractive sites on your laptops or tablets. Not to mention, several studies have found it useful to switch to studying locations once or twice a semester. The environment you are in affects how you learn. The examination room would be completely different from your bedroom. Switching places may help your brain be able to adapt easily to changes in your environment. <br><br>
          And that is it!<br><br>
          Remember, study smart, not hard. This will be even more obvious once you are enrolled in a college course. It may seem a lot of scheduling required but do not fret. Truthfully said, IGCSE is not an insanely challenging course. A brief active recalling session after a day in class will be adequate. Past papers will be beneficial once you are in your last year.<br><br>
          Alright, that is it for now. Leave your thoughts in the comments and if you have any suggestions, be sure to list them down below.<br><br>
