        <h3>Avoiding Common Mistakes In IGCSE Maths Exam</h3>
        <img src="../images/maths_mistake.jpeg">
        <p>
          I have always hated taking Math Exams the most, regardless if it is the extended one or additional. I am a careless exam taker. That simply means that in my calculations, I often get steps wrong due to being reckless and not careful.<br><br>
          This has happened to me multiple times over the past 2 years whether it is during Prelims or Unit tests. It hurts to lose 5 marks in a 6 mark question as your final working slipped one decimal place. <br><br>
          With that being said, this alone does not cover common mistakes in this subject's exams. Here is a list which you really need to avoid if you do not want to lose silly marks:<br><br>
        </p>
          <ol>
            <li><p>Use a calculator at all times, even when doing basic arithmetic operations. You never know when your brain decides to tell you 20-18 = 8. Better safe than sorry</p></li>
            <li><p>Pay attention to the degree of accuracy is specified. Usually, the standard degree of accuracy would be 3 significant figures. For questions about money, it is 2 decimal places and for angles, it is 1 decimal place. All these general rules do not apply if the question specifically states the degree of accuracy.</p></li>
            <li><p>Organise your working in order. Do not write one part of your work on the left and one on the other. Well, I should not say do not. If you do not want to confuse the examiners with your work and lose marks because they did not understand your work, then write your working on one full page going down. A number of examiner reports have stated the need for cleanliness when displaying work</p></li>
            <li><p>Last but not least, ANSWER EVERY QUESTION. This seems obvious enough. A lot of students still forget that you can gain bonus points if you try to answer the question. This does not mean that if your answer is wrong, you will not be deduced points. For example, if you answer a 6 mark question and you get the first 3 steps right, you may be given 2 marks. Not to mention, say that is part(a). If part(b) requires you to know the value of part(a), you may use the answer from part(a) and still gain marks if your method is correct. So, PRETTY PLEASE, answer every question.</p></li>
          </ol>
          <p> And that is it! Do y'all have any other suggestions? If you do, leave them in the comments down below! Cya! </p>
